# Static Site Generator using Node JS

Static Site Generators are a new, hybrid approach to web development that allow you to build a powerful, server-based website locally on your computer but pre-builds the site into static files for deployment.

## Tools Used

We have used [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) to make our own Static Site Generator.

If you're a beginner, you can refer to my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/q1YGCh2Ze4w) in which I explained how to create it from the scratch.

## Requirements

For this project, a basic understanding of following technologies will help:

* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Node JS

## Git Shortcuts

In the video I have made use of my own git aliases, which will not work on your systems.

For building any kind of project like this you can increase your pace by making use of your own shortcuts. In order to create your own shortcuts, you can refer to my blog article: [Git Shortcuts](https://blog.praveen.science/git-shortcuts/).

For setting up a developer environment like me, consider reading my blog on [My Personal Development Environment](https://blog.praveen.science/my-personal-development-environment/).
